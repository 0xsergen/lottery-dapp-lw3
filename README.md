# Lottery dApp
This dApp is built based on tutorial within the scope of Learn Web3 DAO's Junior Class.

1. The owner creates a game by setting entry fee and max player.
2. When max player is reached, winner is selected randomly thanks to ChainLink.
3. All reward pool (entry fees) goes to the winner.

The dApp runs on Mumbai Testnet which is Polygon's testnet.
